Known Issues and Bugs
* Input Validation:
   * While most invalid inputs are handled, some edge cases may cause unexpected behavior.
   * Example: Entering an empty string as input might result in an error message.
* Data Persistence:
   * The program does not save data between sessions. All items are cleared when the program exits.

Future Enhancements
* Implement persistent data storage using JSON or a database to save marketplace data.
* Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved usability.
* Introduce a user authentication system to track user-specific posts and purchases.
